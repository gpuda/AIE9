**Total time:** 20–30 min including warm-up/cool-down

---

### Sunday — Rest + Reset
- Rest day
- Optional: 10–20 min gentle stretching or an easy walk

---

## Progression (How to get stronger without guessing)
- Use a rep range (e.g., 4×5–8).
- When you can hit the **top** of the range for all sets with good form, increase load next week:
  - Upper body: +2–5 lb (1–2 kg)
  - Lower body: +5–10 lb (2–5 kg)
- If you feel run down: keep weight the same and do 1 fewer set per exercise for a week.

---

## Substitutions (if equipment is limited)
- Squat → goblet squat / split squat
- Deadlift/RDL → dumbbell RDL / hip hinge with kettlebell
- Bench → push-ups / DB floor press
- Row → band row / inverted row
- Pulldown/pull-up → band-assisted pull-up / band pulldown

---

## Safety Notes
- Stop any movement that causes sharp pain.
- Keep 1–3 reps “in reserve” most of the time.
- If you’re new, start with 2 sets per lift for the first 2 weeks.
