    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

    "Short-term memory is automatic, lightweight, and scoped to a single conversation, making it ideal for maintaining context with minimal privacy risk, but it cannot support personalization across sessions.

      "Reducing stress is a great goal, and there are several effective strategies you can try. Here are some evidence-based methods:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practicing mindfulness or meditation can help you stay present and reduce anxiety. Even a few minutes a day can make a difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise is a powerful stress reliever. It can boost your mood and improve your overall well-being. Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's walking, dancing, or yoga.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Deep Breathing**: Simple deep breathing exercises can help calm your mind and body. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect with Others**: Talking to friends or family can provide support and help you feel less isolated. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time Management**: Organizing your tasks and setting priorities can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can impact your mood and energy levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep. Establish a calming bedtime routine and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can increase feelings of anxiety and disrupt your sleep, so it might be helpful to monitor your intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a specific area of your life where you feel the most stress? That might help us find tailored strategies for you!\n"

      "3. **Pelvic Tilts**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently flatten your lower back against the floor by tilting your pelvis upward. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this 10-15 times.\n",

    "## ❓ Question #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you decide what constitutes a **\"successful\" wellness interaction** worth storing as an episode? What metadata should you store alongside the episode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Explicit feedback (thumbs up) vs implicit signals\n",
    "- User engagement (did they ask follow-up questions?)\n",
    "- Objective outcomes vs subjective satisfaction\n",
    "- Privacy implications of storing interaction data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "For me, a “successful” wellness interaction is one where the user not only gets correct and safe advice, but also feels understood and motivated to act on it. Explicit signals like positive feedback or a thumbs-up are the clearest indicators, but I’d also treat continued engagement (follow-up questions, asking for a plan, or clarifying details) as a strong sign that the advice resonated.\n",
    "\n",
    "When storing an episode, I would keep just enough metadata to reuse the pattern effectively: the user’s goal or situation, the original question, the structure and tone of the response, and a brief success signal (e.g., “user engaged further” or “feedback was positive”). I would avoid storing unnecessary personal or sensitive data, focusing instead on how the advice worked rather than who the user was, to balance learning value with privacy."

    "## ❓ Question #4:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **production wellness assistant**, which memory types need persistent storage (PostgreSQL) vs in-memory? How would you handle memory across multiple agent instances (e.g., Exercise Agent, Nutrition Agent, Sleep Agent)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Which memories are user-specific vs shared?\n",
    "- Consistency requirements across agents\n",
    "- Memory expiration and cleanup policies\n",
    "- Namespace strategy for multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "In a production wellness assistant, information that needs to be remembered over time, like user profiles, preferences, and agent instructions, should be stored in persistent storage such as PostgreSQL. Short-term conversation memory can stay in-memory because it is only needed during a single interaction and can be safely discarded afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using multiple agents (Exercise, Nutrition, Sleep), user-related memory should be shared so all agents understand the same user, while each agent can have its own domain knowledge. Using clear namespaces and cleaning up old or unused memories helps keep the system consistent, scalable, and respectful of user privacy."

      "**Key Insights:**\n",
      "- Your average sleep duration was around 6.4 hours, which is slightly below the recommended 7-9 hours for optimal health.\n",
      "- Energy and mood levels fluctuated, with lower scores on days with less sleep and no workouts, indicating a potential link between these factors.\n",

      "- Consistency in sleep and exercise could enhance your overall wellness and help stabilize your energy levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Action Plan:**\n",

      "**Action Plan:**\n",
      "1. **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night by going to bed and waking up at the same time every day.\n",
      "2. **Incorporate Daily Movement:** Try to include at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day, even if it's just a brisk walk or stretching.\n",
      "3. **Practice Mindfulness:** Consider a short mindfulness or relaxation practice each day, such as deep breathing or meditation, to help manage stress and improve sleep quality.\n",
      "4. **Limit Stimulants:** Reduce caffeine intake in the afternoon and evening to promote better sleep.\n",

      "1. **Prioritize Sleep:** Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep each night by setting a consistent bedtime and wake-up time. This can help regulate your body's internal clock and improve energy levels.\n",
      "2. **Increase Physical Activity:** Incorporate at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily, even if it's light activities like walking or stretching. This can enhance your energy and mood.\n",
      "3. **Implement a Wind-Down Routine:** Create a calming pre-sleep routine that includes activities like reading or gentle stretching to signal to your body that it's time to relax.\n",
      "4. **Stay Hydrated:** Aim for 8 glasses of water daily, as dehydration can contribute to feelings of fatigue.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
