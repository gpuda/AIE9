    "1. We split the full document into large \"parent\" chunks (e.g. 2000 characters).\n",
    "2. Each parent chunk is further split into smaller \"child\" chunks (e.g. 400 characters).\n",
    "3. The child chunks are stored in a VectorStore, while the parent chunks are stored in an in-memory docstore.\n",

    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive (e.g., FAQs), how might semantic chunking behave, and how would you adjust the algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ✅ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "If sentences are short and highly repetitive, semantic chunking might struggle to detect meaningful differences between them. Since many sentences would be semantically similar, the distance between embeddings would be small, which could result in very large chunks being grouped together instead of cleanly separated sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adjust for this, I would modify the thresholding strategy by making it more sensitive — for example, lowering the percentile threshold so that smaller semantic differences trigger a split. Alternatively, I could combine semantic chunking with a maximum chunk size limit to prevent overly large chunks from forming."

Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises can help alleviate discomfort and prevent future episodes.\\n\\nRecommended exercises for lower back pain include:\\n- Cat-Cow Stretch: Start on hands and knees, alternate between arching your back up (cat) and letting it sag down (cow). Do 10-15 repetitions.\\n- Bird Dog: From hands and knees, extend opposite arm and leg while keeping your core engaged. Hold for 5 seconds, then switch sides. Do 10 repetitions per side.\\n- Partial Crunches: Lie on your back with knees bent, cross arms over chest, tighten stomach muscles and raise shoulders off floor. Hold briefly, then lower. Do 8-12 repetitions.\\n- Knee-to-Chest Stretch: Lie on your back, pull one knee toward your chest while keeping the other foot flat. Hold for 15-30 seconds, then switch legs.\\n- Pelvic Tilts: Lie on your back with knees bent, flatten your back against the floor by tightening abs and tilting pelvis up slightly. Hold for 10 seconds, repeat 8-12 times.\\n\\nNeck and Shoulder Tension\\nDesk work and poor posture often lead to neck and shoulder tension. These exercises can provide relief:\\n- Neck Rolls: Slowly roll your head in a circle, 5 times in each direction.\\n- Shoulder Shrugs: Raise shoulders toward ears, hold for 5 seconds, then release. Repeat 10 times.\\n- Chest Opener: Clasp hands behind back, squeeze shoulder blades together, and lift arms slightly.

The gut microbiome influences immunity, mental health, and nutrient absorption. Supporting digestive health: - Eat fiber-rich foods (25-35 grams daily) - Stay hydrated - Include probiotic foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut) - Eat slowly and chew thoroughly - Manage stress (gut-brain connection) - Exercise regularly - Limit processed foods and artificial sweeteners Foods that support gut health: - Fermented foods: Yogurt, kimchi, kombucha, miso - Prebiotic foods: Garlic, onions, bananas, asparagus - Fiber-rich foods: Whole grains, legumes, vegetables - Bone broth - Ginger and peppermint Chapter 18: Boosting Immune Function A strong immune system helps protect against illness. Lifestyle factors play a significant role in immune health. Immune-boosting strategies: - Get adequate sleep (7-9 hours) - Eat a nutrient-rich diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables - Exercise regularly but moderately - Manage stress effectively - Stay hydrated - Maintain a healthy weight - Don\\'t smoke and limit alcohol - Practice good hygiene Key nutrients for immunity: - Vitamin C: Citrus fruits, bell peppers, strawberries - Vitamin D: Sunlight, fatty fish, fortified foods - Zinc: Oysters, beef, pumpkin seeds, chickpeas - Vitamin E: Nuts, seeds, spinach - Elderberry: May help reduce duration of colds PART 7: LIFESTYLE AND WELLNESS Chapter 19: Work-Life Balance Maintaining balance between professional responsibilities and personal life is essential for long-term well-being.

    "\n",
    "In this activity, multiple retriever strategies were evaluated using a synthetic golden dataset and RAGAS retrieval metrics (context_precision and context_recall), along with latency per query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Parent Document Retriever** provides the best overall balance for this dataset. It achieves very high precision (0.90) and strong recall (0.74), meaning it retrieves highly relevant context while still covering most of the ground-truth information. Its latency (~12 seconds per query) is also reasonable compared to more complex approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the **Ensemble retriever** achieved the highest recall (0.80), it introduced significantly more noise (low precision) and much higher latency, making it less practical for real-world deployment. Multi-query and compression methods improved recall compared to naive retrieval but added additional latency due to LLM-based processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Parent retriever offers the best trade-off between performance, latency, and practical usability for this dataset."
