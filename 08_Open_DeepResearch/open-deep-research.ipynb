    "The Researcher State is used by individual sub-agents to do focused research. Each researcher has its own state so they can work independently without interfering with each other.\n",

    "## 🏗️ Chosen prompt template: lead_researcher_prompt \n",
    "#### 1) What the prompt is designed to accomplish:\n",
    "\n",
    "This prompt is designed to turn the language model into a research supervisor, not a researcher. Its main goal is to plan and coordinate the research process, rather than collecting information itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of answering the question directly, the supervisor decides:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - how the research should be broken down,\n",
    "    - whether the task can be handled by one researcher or needs multiple parallel researchers,\n",
    "    - when enough information has been gathered to stop researching\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt enforces a clear workflow where the supervisor delegates research using tools, evaluates the results, and then signals completion when the findings are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Key techniques used in the prompt: \n",
    "\n",
    "a) Strong role definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt clearly defines the model’s role as a research supervisor. It explicitly states that the supervisor’s job is to delegate research and manage progress, not to write the final report. This prevents the model from drifting into free-form answering.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Structured tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "The research supervisor is required to use specific tools (ConductResearch, ResearchComplete, and think_tool). This ensures that actions like delegation and completion happen in a controlled, predictable way rather than through unstructured text.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Reflection and limits\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt forces the supervisor to pause and reflect using think_tool before and after delegating tasks. It also introduces hard limits on the number of delegations and parallel agents, which helps control cost, token usage, and infinite research loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) One improvement suggestion:\n",
    "\n",
    "One improvement would be to define clearer and more consistent output requirements for each delegated research task. For example, the supervisor could explicitly instruct each researcher to return a fixed number of key findings (e.g. 3–5 points) along with a specific number of sources for each finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would help standardize the quality and structure of the research outputs. Currently, different researchers may return results in varying levels of detail or formats, which makes it harder to merge their findings later. By setting clear expectations upfront, the supervisor would receive more predictable and comparable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the compression and final report stages would become simpler and more reliable, because the system would be combining well-structured research summaries rather than inconsistent free-form notes."

    "2. **Parallel Execution**\n",

       "\n",
       "## Understanding Your Sleep Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "Your current sleep difficulties—inconsistent bedtimes, phone use in bed, and morning fatigue—are interconnected issues that significantly impact sleep quality. Research from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine demonstrates that irregular sleep-wake patterns disrupt circadian rhythms, while blue light exposure from electronic devices suppresses melatonin production by up to 23% [1]. Morning fatigue despite adequate sleep duration often indicates poor sleep quality rather than insufficient sleep quantity, frequently resulting from fragmented sleep cycles caused by these behavioral patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "The variability in your bedtime (10pm-1am) creates a condition similar to \"social jet lag,\" where your internal biological clock becomes misaligned with your sleep schedule. Studies published in Sleep Medicine Reviews show that bedtime variability of more than 30 minutes can reduce sleep efficiency and increase daytime sleepiness [2]. Your phone use in bed compounds this issue by providing both psychological arousal through content consumption and physiological disruption through blue light exposure during the critical pre-sleep period.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Optimal Sleep Timing and Consistency Practices\n",
       "\n",
       "### Establishing Your Ideal Sleep Schedule\n",
       "\n",
       "Research from the Journal of Clinical Medicine indicates that consistency is more important than the specific bedtime chosen, provided it aligns with your natural chronotype [3]. For most adults, a bedtime between 10:00-11:00 PM optimizes alignment with natural melatonin production, which typically begins around 9:00 PM. Given your current range of 10pm-1am, targeting a consistent 10:30 PM bedtime represents a realistic compromise that doesn't require dramatic schedule shifts.\n",
       "\n",
       "The National Sleep Foundation recommends implementing a \"15-minute rule\" for schedule adjustment: shift your bedtime by only 15 minutes earlier each night until you reach your target time [4]. This gradual approach prevents the circadian disruption that occurs with sudden schedule changes. For your situation, if you're currently going to bed at 1:00 AM, plan a 2-3 week transition period to reach 10:30 PM consistently.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Weekend Sleep Schedule Management\n",
       "\n",
       "Clinical sleep research published in Sleep Health demonstrates that weekend sleep schedule variations should not exceed 1 hour from weekday schedules to maintain circadian stability [5]. This means if your target bedtime is 10:30 PM on weeknights, weekend bedtimes should remain between 10:00-11:30 PM. Similarly, wake times should vary by no more than 1 hour on weekends to prevent \"Sunday night insomnia\" and Monday morning fatigue.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Implementation Strategy for Consistency\n",
       "\n",
       "Sleep medicine experts recommend using \"anchor points\" to establish consistency: fixed wake times are more powerful than fixed bedtimes for regulating circadian rhythms [6]. Choose a wake time you can maintain 7 days per week, then work backward 7-9 hours to determine your ideal bedtime. Use bright light exposure within 30 minutes of waking and dim lighting 2 hours before bedtime to reinforce your chosen schedule.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Evidence-Based Methods for Reducing Phone and Screen Usage Before Bed\n",
       "\n",
       "### Understanding the Science of Blue Light Impact\n",
       "\n",
       "Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that blue light exposure (particularly wavelengths between 460-480nm) suppresses melatonin production for up to 3 hours after exposure [7]. Smartphones emit significant blue light in this range, with studies indicating that 2 hours of evening tablet use can delay melatonin onset by approximately 1.5 hours. This delay directly correlates with increased sleep onset latency and reduced REM sleep quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Practical Digital Sunset Strategies\n",
       "\n",
       "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends implementing a \"digital sunset\" 1-2 hours before bedtime [8]. For your 10:30 PM target bedtime, this means ceasing phone use by 8:30-9:30 PM. Research from Harvard Medical School suggests a graduated approach works better than complete elimination:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Week 1-2**: Move your phone charger outside the bedroom and use an analog alarm clock. This removes the temptation for bedtime phone use while maintaining functionality.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Week 3-4**: Implement a \"phone parking\" station in your living room where all devices charge overnight, creating a physical barrier to evening use.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Week 5+**: Establish phone-free evening activities during your digital sunset period, such as reading, gentle stretching, or preparation for the next day.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Technology-Based Solutions\n",
       "\n",
       "If complete elimination isn't immediately feasible, research supports harm-reduction approaches. Studies in Applied Ergonomics show that blue light filtering glasses can reduce melatonin suppression by up to 58% when worn 2-3 hours before bedtime [9]. Additionally, enabling \"night mode\" or blue light filters on devices after sunset can reduce circadian disruption, though complete avoidance remains optimal.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Strategies to Improve Morning Energy Levels\n",
       "\n",
       "### Addressing Sleep Inertia\n",
       "\n",
       "Morning fatigue despite adequate sleep duration often indicates \"sleep inertia,\" a neurophysiological state lasting 15 minutes to 4 hours after awakening. Research in Sleep Medicine Clinics identifies several evidence-based interventions for reducing sleep inertia [10]:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Strategic Light Exposure**: Bright light therapy (2500-10000 lux) within 30 minutes of waking can reduce morning grogginess by up to 50%. Position yourself near a window or use a light therapy device for 20-30 minutes while having breakfast or coffee.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Consistent Wake Times**: Studies show that waking at the same time daily, including weekends, reduces sleep inertia severity by maintaining circadian alignment. Set your alarm for the same time every day, regardless of bedtime variations during your transition period.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Optimizing Sleep Architecture\n",
       "\n",
       "Morning energy levels depend heavily on sleep stage timing at awakening. Research from the Journal of Sleep Research indicates that waking during light sleep stages (N1/N2) rather than deep sleep (N3) or REM sleep significantly improves morning alertness [11]. Since natural sleep cycles average 90-110 minutes, timing your sleep for complete cycles can improve morning energy:\n",
       "\n",
       "- For a 6:30 AM wake time, optimal bedtimes are 9:00 PM, 10:30 PM, or 12:00 AM (allowing for 15-20 minutes to fall asleep)\n",
       "- Track your natural awakening patterns during weekends to identify your personal sleep cycle length\n",
       "\n",
       "### Morning Routine Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "Clinical research supports specific morning practices for enhancing alertness and energy. The Sleep Research Society recommends a morning routine including [12]:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Immediate light exposure**: Open curtains or go outside within 15 minutes of waking to suppress residual melatonin and activate cortisol production.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Hydration**: Drink 16-20 oz of water upon waking to address overnight dehydration, which contributes to morning fatigue.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Gentle movement**: 5-10 minutes of light stretching or walking increases circulation and accelerates the transition from sleep to wake physiology.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Delayed caffeine**: Wait 60-90 minutes after waking before consuming caffeine to allow natural cortisol awakening response and prevent afternoon crashes.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comprehensive Sleep Hygiene Techniques\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sleep Environment Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "The National Sleep Foundation's sleep environment research identifies several critical factors for optimal sleep quality [13]:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Temperature Control**: Maintain bedroom temperature between 65-68°F (18-20°C). Core body temperature naturally drops during sleep onset, and a cool environment facilitates this process. Studies show that temperatures above 70°F or below 60°F can significantly fragment sleep.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Darkness Optimization**: Complete darkness is crucial for maintaining natural melatonin production. Use blackout curtains or eye masks to eliminate light pollution. Even small amounts of light (such as from electronic device indicators) can disrupt sleep architecture.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Noise Management**: Maintain bedroom noise levels below 35 decibels when possible. If environmental noise is unavoidable, consistent white noise or earplugs can mask disruptive sounds without creating sleep fragmentation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pre-Sleep Routine Development\n",
       "\n",
       "Research in Behavioral Sleep Medicine demonstrates that consistent pre-sleep routines can reduce sleep onset time by 37% within 2-4 weeks of implementation [14]. Your routine should begin 60-90 minutes before bedtime and include only relaxing, non-stimulating activities:\n",
       "\n",
       "**60-90 minutes before bed**: Begin dimming lights throughout your home and start your digital sunset period.\n",
       "\n",
       "**45-60 minutes before bed**: Engage in calming activities such as reading (physical books only), gentle stretching, or preparation for the next day.\n",
       "\n",
       "**15-30 minutes before bed**: Practice relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing exercises, or meditation.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Dietary and Exercise Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "Sleep research identifies several dietary and activity factors that significantly impact sleep quality:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Meal Timing**: Finish eating large meals at least 3 hours before bedtime. Late eating can disrupt circadian rhythms and cause sleep fragmentation. If evening hunger occurs, limit intake to small, easily digestible snacks.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Exercise Timing**: Regular moderate exercise improves sleep quality by 65% in most individuals, but timing matters [15]. Morning or afternoon exercise enhances nighttime sleep, while vigorous exercise within 3 hours of bedtime can increase sleep onset time and reduce sleep efficiency.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Caffeine Management**: Limit caffeine intake after 2:00 PM, as caffeine has a half-life of 5-7 hours and can disrupt sleep even when consumed 6 hours before bedtime.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sleep Position and Mattress Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "Orthopedic sleep research indicates that sleep position affects both sleep quality and morning energy levels. Side sleeping (particularly left side) promotes better circulation and can reduce sleep apnea symptoms that contribute to morning fatigue [16]. Ensure your pillow maintains neutral spine alignment and replace mattresses every 7-10 years to maintain proper support.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Implementation Timeline and Monitoring\n",
       "\n",
       "### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation Building\n",
       "- Establish consistent wake time (7 days/week)\n",
       "- Move phone charging station outside bedroom\n",
       "- Begin 15-minute bedtime adjustments toward 10:30 PM target\n",
       "- Implement basic sleep environment optimizations (temperature, darkness)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Routine Development\n",
       "- Establish complete digital sunset routine\n",
       "- Develop consistent 60-minute pre-sleep routine\n",
       "- Fine-tune bedroom environment (noise, comfort)\n",
       "- Monitor morning energy levels and adjust as needed\n",
       "\n",
       "### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8): Optimization and Maintenance\n",
       "- Achieve consistent 10:30 PM bedtime\n",
       "- Refine morning routine for optimal energy\n",
       "- Address any remaining sleep quality issues\n",
       "- Establish long-term maintenance strategies\n",
       "\n",
       "### Progress Monitoring\n",
       "\n",
       "Track your sleep improvement using both subjective and objective measures. Keep a sleep diary noting bedtime, sleep onset time, nighttime awakenings, wake time, and morning energy levels (rated 1-10). Research shows that individuals who track their sleep improvement are 40% more likely to maintain positive changes long-term [17].\n",

    "Your request was transformed into a detailed research brief that guides the supervisor's delegation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Supervisor Delegation\n",
    "The supervisor analyzed the brief and decided how to break down the research:\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to plan strategy\n",
    "- Called `ConductResearch` to delegate to researchers\n",
    "- Each delegation specified a focused research topic (e.g., sleep hygiene, circadian rhythm, blue light effects)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Parallel Research\n",
    "Researchers worked on their assigned topics:\n",
    "- Each researcher used web search tools to gather information\n",
    "- Used `think_tool` to reflect after each search\n",
    "- Decided when they had enough information\n",
    "- Compressed their findings into clean summaries\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Using parallel researchers allows the system to explore multiple aspects of a question at the same time, which significantly reduces overall execution time and is well suited for broad or open-ended research. It also helps uncover diverse perspectives that might be missed in a strictly sequential approach.\n",

    "Persistent storage + audit trail: Save briefs, tool results, citations, and final reports in a database so users can revisit past plans and the system can support debugging/compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observability + evals: Logging, tracing, and automated evaluations (quality, citation coverage, hallucination checks) plus monitoring for latency/cost regressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source quality controls: Domain allowlists/blocklists, ranking heuristics, and citation verification to prefer reputable medical sources and reduce misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Caching + rate limiting: Cache search and summarization results and add rate limits per user to control cost and avoid abuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human-in-the-loop workflows: Escalation paths for sensitive cases (e.g., sleep issues + severe symptoms) and optional clinician review for high-impact recommendations.\n",

       "Based on your current ability to run 30 minutes continuously at 6:45 min/km pace with 3 weekly running sessions, you demonstrate a solid foundation for aerobic base development. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that beginner runners focus primarily on time-based progression rather than intensity-based training during the initial months of running [1]. Your current pace suggests you're running at approximately 65-75% of maximum heart rate, which aligns well with aerobic base development zones.\n",

       "#### Shin Splint Prevention\n",
       "- **Toe walks**: 30 seconds, 2 sets\n",
       "- **Heel walks**: 30 seconds, 2 sets\n",
       "- **Alphabet draws with toes**: 2 sets each foot\n",
       "- **Progressive loading**: Increase weekly mileage by maximum 10%\n",
       "- **Surface variation**: Mix soft surfaces (trails, tracks) with pavement\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Knee Injury Prevention\n",
       "- **Hip strengthening**: Focus on glute medius and maximus\n",

       "\n",
       "### Daily Recovery Practices\n",
       "- **Sleep**: 7-9 hours nightly for optimal adaptation\n",
       "- **Hydration**: Monitor urine color (pale yellow indicates adequate hydration)\n",
       "- **Nutrition**: Consume carbohydrates within 30 minutes post-run, maintain adequate protein intake (1.2-1.6g/kg body weight daily)\n",
       "- **Heart rate variability**: Track resting heart rate; increases >10 bpm may indicate inadequate recovery\n",
       "\n",
       "### Weekly Recovery Assessment\n",
       "- **Subjective wellness questionnaire**: Rate sleep quality, muscle soreness, motivation, and stress levels (1-5 scale)\n",
       "- **Running pace consistency**: Easy runs should feel progressively easier at same pace\n",
       "- **Strength maintenance**: Ability to complete prescribed strength exercises without significant fatigue\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety Guidelines and Training Modification\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immediate Stop Indicators\n",
       "- **Sharp, localized pain** during or after running\n",
       "- **Chest pain, dizziness, or unusual breathlessness** during exercise\n",
       "- **Swelling, heat, or persistent tenderness** in joints or muscles\n",
       "- **Gait alterations** due to pain or discomfort\n",
       "- **Illness symptoms**: Fever, persistent cough, or systemic fatigue\n",
       "\n",
       "### Program Modification Protocols\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Minor Discomfort Management\n",
       "- **Reduce training volume by 20-30%** while maintaining frequency\n",
       "- **Eliminate tempo and harder efforts**, focus on easy-paced running\n",
       "- **Increase recovery time between sessions**\n",
       "- **Implement additional stretching and strengthening for affected areas**\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Persistent Issues (>3 days)\n",
       "- **Take 2-3 complete rest days** from running\n",
       "- **Maintain cross-training** with low-impact activities (swimming, cycling)\n",
       "- **Continue strength training** if not contraindicated\n",
       "- **Consult healthcare provider** if symptoms persist beyond one week\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Return to Training Protocol\n",
       "- **Resume at 50% previous volume** after symptom resolution\n",
       "- **Progress weekly increases to 5-8%** rather than 10%\n",
       "- **Monitor symptoms closely** for recurrence\n",
       "- **Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and stress management**\n",

       "- **Total running time progression**\n",
       "- **Subjective exertion ratings**\n",
       "- **Heart rate response consistency**\n",
       "- **Recovery quality markers**\n",

       "## Overview and Training Philosophy\n",
       "\n",
       "Aerobic base building for recreational runners over 40 with existing knee pain requires a careful balance between progressive overload and injury prevention. Research demonstrates that 80-90% of training should occur at low intensities (Zone 1-2) to maximize aerobic adaptations while minimizing injury risk [1]. The polarized training model, emphasizing high-volume easy running with minimal moderate-intensity work, has been shown to be particularly effective for recreational runners and those managing joint issues [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "For runners with knee pain, the primary focus must be on gradual volume increases of no more than 10% per week, proper load management, and integration of strength training to address biomechanical deficiencies [3]. Studies show that runners over 40 benefit from increased recovery time between sessions and lower training frequencies compared to younger athletes [4].\n",

       "\n",
       "**Zone 1 (Easy/Recovery): 60-70% HRmax (107-125 bpm)**\n",
       "- Perceived Exertion: 3-4/10\n",

       "\n",
       "**Biomechanical Focus:**\n",
       "- Maintain cadence between 170-180 steps per minute to reduce impact forces\n",
       "- Focus on midfoot landing rather than heel striking\n",
       "- Avoid overstriding by increasing turnover rate\n",
       "\n",
       "**Strength Training Priorities:**\n",
       "- Hip abductor strengthening reduces knee valgus stress\n",
       "- Quadriceps and glutes strengthening improves patellofemoral tracking\n",
       "- Single-leg stability work addresses functional deficits\n",
       "\n",
       "### Calf and Shin Protection\n",
       "**Calf Injury Prevention:**\n",
       "- Gradual volume increases prevent overuse injuries\n",
       "- Eccentric calf strengthening (negative calf raises) 2-3x per week\n",
       "- Dynamic warm-up including calf raises and ankle circles\n",
       "\n",
       "**Shin Splint Prevention:**\n",
       "- Avoid sudden increases in training intensity or surface changes\n",
       "- Strengthen tibialis anterior with toe walks and resistance band exercises\n",
       "- Ensure proper footwear with adequate cushioning and support\n",
       "\n",
       "### Recovery Protocols\n",
       "**Daily Recovery Practices:**\n",
       "- 10-15 minutes post-run stretching focusing on calves, hamstrings, and hip flexors\n",
       "- Ice application to knees for 10-15 minutes after runs if pain is present\n",
       "- Elevation of legs for 10-15 minutes post-exercise\n",
       "\n",
       "**Weekly Recovery Sessions:**\n",
       "- 20-30 minute gentle yoga or stretching session\n",
       "- Self-massage using foam roller or massage ball\n",
       "- Cross-training alternatives: swimming, cycling, or elliptical if running causes pain\n",
       "\n",
       "## Safety Protocols and Warning Signs\n",
       "\n",
       "### Immediate Stop Indicators\n",
       "Research establishes clear criteria for stopping training to prevent serious injury [9]:\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pain-Related Warning Signs:**\n",
       "- Sharp, acute pain during or after running\n",
       "- Pain that worsens during a run\n",
       "- Pain that interferes with normal walking\n",
       "- Pain that persists for more than 2-3 days after running\n",
       "- Swelling or visible inflammation around joints\n",
       "\n",
       "**Systemic Warning Signs:**\n",
       "- Persistent fatigue lasting more than 48 hours\n",
       "- Elevated resting heart rate (10+ bpm above normal)\n",
       "- Sleep disturbances or mood changes\n",
       "- Decreased performance despite adequate recovery\n",
       "\n",
       "### Pain Management Guidelines\n",
       "**Acceptable Training Pain Levels:**\n",
       "- Mild discomfort (1-3/10 pain scale) that doesn't worsen during activity\n",
       "- Stiffness that improves with gentle movement\n",
       "- Muscle soreness that resolves within 24-48 hours\n",
       "\n",
       "**Modification Protocols:**\n",
       "- If knee pain reaches 4/10 or higher, reduce training volume by 20-30%\n",
       "- If pain persists for 3 consecutive training days, take 2-3 complete rest days\n",
       "- Consider cross-training alternatives if running pain exceeds 3/10\n",
       "\n",
       "### Progressive Return Guidelines\n",
       "After any training interruption due to pain:\n",
       "- Resume at 70% of previous volume\n",
       "- Increase by no more than 10% per week\n",
       "- Monitor pain levels daily using 1-10 scale\n",
       "- Seek professional evaluation if pain persists beyond 7-10 days\n",
       "\n",
       "## Training Load Management\n",
       "\n",
       "### Monitoring and Adjustment\n",
       "**Weekly Assessment Protocol:**\n",
       "- Rate overall fatigue (1-10 scale) each Sunday\n",
       "- Track knee pain levels before, during, and after each run\n",
       "- Monitor sleep quality and duration\n",
       "- Record resting heart rate trends\n",
       "\n",
       "**Load Adjustment Criteria:**\n",
       "- If weekly fatigue rating exceeds 7/10, reduce next week's volume by 15-20%\n",
       "- If knee pain trends upward over 3 consecutive sessions, implement rest day\n",
       "- If performance declines despite adequate recovery, consider deload week\n",
       "\n",
       "**Environmental and Surface Considerations:**\n",
       "- Prioritize softer surfaces (trails, tracks, treadmill) over concrete\n",
       "- Adjust training intensity based on weather conditions\n",
       "- Consider indoor alternatives during extreme temperatures\n",
       "\n",
       "The 8-week progression emphasizes gradual adaptation while respecting the constraints of existing knee pain. Success depends on consistent monitoring, appropriate load management, and willingness to modify the plan based on individual response. The integration of strength training and injury prevention strategies provides a comprehensive approach to long-term running health and performance improvement.\n",

    "## 💡Output Review (What Worked Well vs. Improvements)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What worked well**\n",
    "- The system produced a structured, actionable 8-week plan (week-by-week schedule, intensity guidance, strength, injury prevention, and safety rules).\n",
    "- Even with conservative limits (1 iteration, 2 tool calls), the report remained coherent and comprehensive.\n",
    "- Including a sources section improves trust and makes key claims easier to validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What could be improved**\n",
    "- Personalization could be stronger with a short clarification step (age, injury history, footwear, typical weekly schedule, preferred training days).\n",
    "- Source governance: citations could prioritize sports medicine guidelines and beginner-focused endurance training sources; a few references (e.g., HIIT-focused papers) may be less directly relevant to aerobic base building for beginners.\n",
    "- Add a simple tracking/check-in template (weekly minutes, RPE, soreness score, sleep quality) to help the user iterate and adjust load safely.\n",
